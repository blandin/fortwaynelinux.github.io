title: Subsetting the Meetup.com Group
author: Ben Landin
---

As we are now established on GetTogether, and due to lack of remaining membership, our Meetup.com group will be closing entirely on Friday, June 7. We have sent out a few limited communiqu√©s over the past couple weeks, but we had yet to announce this publicly. We will continue to host events as usual, so please [join us on GetTogether](https://gettogether.community/fort-wayne-linux-users-group/).
